# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

## Purpose
This document outlines the key performance indicators used to measure the effectiveness of the incident response process.

## KPIs Overview
1. **Detection Rate**:
   - Measures the percentage of incidents detected by monitoring tools (e.g., Splunk) versus total incidents.

2. **Response Time**:
   - Average time taken to respond to and mitigate incidents.
   - Target: Less than [insert target hours] for critical incidents.

3. **Recovery Time**:
   - Average time taken to recover systems and resume normal operations after an incident.
   - Target: Less than [insert target hours] for critical incidents.

4. **Incident Volume**:
   - Total number of incidents reported within a specific timeframe.
   - Used to identify trends and areas requiring more resources.

5. **Incident Closure Rate**:
   - Percentage of incidents closed within the defined response timeframe.
   - Target: At least [insert percentage]% of incidents closed within the SLA.

6. **Post-Incident Review Completion Rate**:
   - Percentage of incidents followed by a completed post-incident review.
   - Target: 100% of incidents undergo post-incident reviews.

## Monitoring and Reporting
- KPIs will be tracked and reported on a quarterly basis.
- Findings will be reviewed by the Incident Response Team to identify trends and make data-driven improvements to the incident response process.

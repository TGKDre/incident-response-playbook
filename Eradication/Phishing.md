# Phishing Eradication

## Steps for Eradication
1. **Remove Malicious Emails**:
   - Utilize email filtering solutions (e.g., **Proofpoint**, **Mimecast**) to delete phishing emails from user inboxes.

2. **Conduct a Security Assessment**:
   - Review security logs in **Splunk** to identify any compromised accounts or unauthorized access stemming from phishing.

3. **Update Security Protocols**:
   - Revise email security policies and update filtering rules to block similar phishing attempts in the future.

4. **User Training and Awareness**:
   - Implement additional training sessions focused on recognizing phishing attempts and best practices for email security.

## Tools and NIST Recommendations
- **User Behavior Analytics (UBA)**:
  - Use UBA features in **Splunk** to identify any unusual user activity patterns indicative of phishing exploitation.

- Regularly test employees with simulated phishing attacks to assess and enhance their awareness and response capabilities.

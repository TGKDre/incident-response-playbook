# Data Breach Eradication

## Steps for Eradication
1. **Identify Compromised Systems**:
   - Use **Splunk** to analyze logs and identify all systems that may have been compromised during the data breach.

2. **Remove Unauthorized Access**:
   - Disable or change credentials for accounts that were found to have unauthorized access.

3. **Patch Vulnerabilities**:
   - Address and patch any security vulnerabilities that were exploited to gain unauthorized access.

4. **Implement Monitoring Controls**:
   - Enhance logging and monitoring capabilities to detect any future unauthorized access attempts.

## Tools and NIST Recommendations
- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**:
  - Implement DLP solutions to monitor and control the movement of sensitive data within the organization.

- Conduct a thorough post-incident analysis to understand how the breach occurred and what measures can be put in place to prevent recurrence.

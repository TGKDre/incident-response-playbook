# DDoS Post-Incident

## Steps for Post-Incident Review
1. **Analyze Attack Data**:
   - Use **Splunk** to review traffic patterns during the DDoS attack to understand the attack vector and scale.
   - Document the sources and types of traffic that contributed to the attack.

2. **Evaluate Mitigation Strategies**:
   - Assess the effectiveness of the DDoS protection measures that were in place during the incident.
   - Report findings to management and provide recommendations for improving defenses.

3. **Update Incident Response Plan**:
   - Revise the incident response plan to include updated DDoS mitigation strategies based on lessons learned from the attack.
   - Ensure procedures for rapid response to future DDoS incidents are documented.

4. **Staff Training**:
   - Conduct training sessions to familiarize staff with DDoS response procedures and the tools used for mitigation.

## Tools and NIST Recommendations
- **Traffic Analysis Tools**:
  - Implement tools like **NetWitness** to continuously monitor network traffic and identify potential DDoS threats.

- Conduct a tabletop exercise to simulate a DDoS attack and evaluate the effectiveness of incident response protocols.

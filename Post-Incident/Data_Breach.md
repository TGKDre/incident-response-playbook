# Data Breach Post-Incident

## Steps for Post-Incident Review
1. **Conduct a Comprehensive Investigation**:
   - Analyze logs in **Splunk** to identify the scope of the breach and the data that was compromised.
   - Document vulnerabilities that allowed unauthorized access.

2. **Assess Regulatory Compliance**:
   - Determine if any regulatory requirements were breached (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) and if notifications are needed.
   - Report findings to legal and compliance teams.

3. **Update Security Policies**:
   - Revise security policies and protocols to address identified weaknesses and prevent future breaches.
   - Implement additional security controls where necessary.

4. **Communication with Stakeholders**:
   - Inform affected parties and stakeholders about the breach, outlining the steps taken to mitigate damage and improve security.

## Tools and NIST Recommendations
- **Data Classification Tools**:
  - Utilize tools like **Symantec DLP** to classify and protect sensitive data within the organization.

- Conduct regular security audits and risk assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

# Ransomware Post-Incident

## Steps for Post-Incident Review
1. **Conduct a Root Cause Analysis**:
   - Review logs in **Splunk** to identify how the ransomware gained access and spread within the network.
   - Document vulnerabilities that were exploited during the incident.

2. **Assess the Impact**:
   - Evaluate the damage caused by the ransomware, including data loss, downtime, and recovery costs.
   - Report findings to management and relevant stakeholders.

3. **Update Incident Response Plan**:
   - Revise the incident response plan based on lessons learned to improve future responses to ransomware incidents.
   - Ensure updated policies include enhanced detection and response protocols.

4. **User Training**:
   - Conduct training sessions for employees to recognize and report potential ransomware threats, utilizing insights from the incident.

## Tools and NIST Recommendations
- **Forensics Analysis Tools**:
  - Use forensic tools to analyze affected systems and understand the attack vector used by the ransomware.

- Conduct a tabletop exercise to simulate a ransomware attack and evaluate the effectiveness of the incident response plan.

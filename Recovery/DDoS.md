# DDoS Recovery

## Steps for Recovery
1. **Restore Service Availability**:
   - Work with DDoS mitigation service providers (e.g., **Cloudflare**, **Akamai**) to ensure that services are fully restored and operational.
   - Verify that legitimate traffic is flowing without disruption.

2. **Evaluate Network Performance**:
   - Use **Splunk** to monitor network performance and ensure no lingering effects from the DDoS attack remain.
   - Assess network capacity to handle traffic post-attack and make necessary adjustments.

3. **Update DDoS Defense Strategies**:
   - Implement improved DDoS protection strategies based on lessons learned from the attack.
   - Review and update network configurations to enhance resilience against future attacks.

4. **Conduct a Review Session**:
   - Hold a debrief with stakeholders to discuss the effectiveness of the response and recovery efforts.

## Tools and NIST Recommendations
- **Traffic Management Tools**:
  - Utilize traffic management solutions to balance loads and optimize network performance during peak traffic periods.

- Conduct regular drills to prepare for potential DDoS attacks and refine response protocols accordingly.

# Ransomware Recovery

## Steps for Recovery
1. **Restore Data from Backups**:
   - Identify and restore data from clean backups that were created prior to the ransomware infection.
   - Ensure that backups are free from malware before restoring them to operational systems.

2. **Verify System Integrity**:
   - Use **Splunk** to monitor system logs and ensure that all malware has been eradicated and systems are functioning properly.
   - Run integrity checks on restored data to ensure it has not been corrupted.

3. **Reinforce Security Measures**:
   - Implement additional security controls (e.g., advanced endpoint protection) to prevent future ransomware infections.
   - Update and patch all systems to close vulnerabilities that were exploited during the attack.

4. **Continuous Monitoring**:
   - Set up continuous monitoring with **Splunk** to detect any unusual activity that may indicate a resurgence of the ransomware.

## Tools and NIST Recommendations
- **Backup Solutions**:
  - Ensure that backup solutions are properly configured and tested regularly to facilitate quick recovery in future incidents.

- Conduct a review of the incident response process to identify areas for improvement and update the inci

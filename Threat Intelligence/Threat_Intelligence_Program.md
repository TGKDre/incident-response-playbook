# Threat Intelligence Program

## Purpose
This document outlines the steps to establish a robust threat intelligence program within the organization, aimed at enhancing security posture through informed decision-making.

## 1. Define Objectives
- **Identify Goals**: Determine the specific goals of the threat intelligence program (e.g., reducing incident response time, improving threat detection).
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Involve key stakeholders from IT, security, and management to align objectives with organizational priorities.

## 2. Data Collection
### Sources of Data
- **Internal Data**: Logs from SIEM systems (e.g., Splunk), vulnerability scans, and past incident reports.
- **External Data**: Subscriptions to threat intelligence services, open-source intelligence, and community sharing platforms.

### Collection Methods
- **Automated Tools**: Utilize APIs and integrations to automatically collect data from threat intelligence feeds.
- **Manual Collection**: Regularly review OSINT sources and community updates for relevant threat information.

## 3. Data Analysis
### Techniques
- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**: Analyze data to identify IoCs, such as IP addresses, file hashes, and URLs related to known threats.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Use machine learning algorithms to recognize patterns in attack methodologies.

### Tools
- **Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIPs)**: Implement platforms like Recorded Future or ThreatConnect to aggregate and analyze threat data.

## 4. Dissemination
- **Reports**: Generate regular reports summarizing the threat landscape and potential impacts on the organization.
- **Alerts**: Create automated alerts for high-priority threats and distribute them to relevant teams (e.g., security, IT, management).

## 5. Integration with Incident Response
- **Collaboration with Incident Response Teams**: Ensure that threat intelligence is integrated into the incident response process to enhance decision-making.
- **Feedback Loop**: Establish a feedback mechanism to continuously improve the threat intelligence program based on lessons learned from incidents.

## Conclusion
A well-defined threat intelligence program strengthens the organizationâ€™s defenses against emerging threats. Regular reviews and updates are essential to adapt to the evolving threat landscape.

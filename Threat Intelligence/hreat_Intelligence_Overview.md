# Threat Intelligence Overview

## Purpose
This document provides an overview of threat intelligence, its types, sources, and its role in enhancing the organization's cybersecurity posture.

## What is Threat Intelligence?
Threat intelligence is the collection and analysis of information about current and potential threats to an organization's security. It enables proactive defense measures and informed decision-making.

## Types of Threat Intelligence
1. **Strategic Threat Intelligence**
   - **Description**: High-level information that informs decision-makers about potential threats and trends.
   - **Use Cases**: Risk assessment, investment in security tools, and organizational strategy.

2. **Tactical Threat Intelligence**
   - **Description**: Information regarding specific threats, including tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries.
   - **Use Cases**: Tailoring defenses against known attack vectors.

3. **Operational Threat Intelligence**
   - **Description**: Time-sensitive information that supports ongoing operations, such as specific threat indicators.
   - **Use Cases**: Immediate response to active threats, such as alerts and indicators of compromise (IoCs).

4. **Technical Threat Intelligence**
   - **Description**: Detailed data regarding the technical aspects of threats, including malware hashes, IP addresses, and vulnerability details.
   - **Use Cases**: Enriching security tools and improving detection capabilities.

## Sources of Threat Intelligence
- **Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)**: Publicly available data sources, such as blogs, forums, and threat reports.
- **Commercial Threat Intelligence Feeds**: Paid subscriptions to threat intelligence services that provide curated data.
- **Internal Intelligence**: Data generated from the organizationâ€™s own security tools, logs, and incident responses.
- **Information Sharing Communities**: Collaborative groups that share threat information among organizations (e.g., ISACs).

## Conclusion
Effective threat intelligence is crucial for anticipating and mitigating threats. This document should be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect the evolving threat landscape.

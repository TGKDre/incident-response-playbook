# Incident Response Procedure

## Purpose
To outline the step-by-step procedures for detecting, responding to, and recovering from cybersecurity incidents.

## Procedure Overview
1. **Preparation**:
   - Maintain an updated incident response plan.
   - Conduct regular training and awareness programs.

2. **Detection and Analysis**:
   - Monitor systems and networks for signs of incidents using SIEM tools like **Splunk**.
   - Assess alerts and determine the nature and severity of the incident.

3. **Containment**:
   - Implement immediate measures to limit the impact of the incident (e.g., isolating affected systems).
   - Determine whether containment is short-term or long-term.

4. **Eradication**:
   - Identify and remove the root cause of the incident.
   - Verify that systems are free from malware and vulnerabilities.

5. **Recovery**:
   - Restore systems and data from clean backups.
   - Validate the integrity of systems before returning them to production.

6. **Post-Incident Activity**:
   - Conduct a post-incident review to assess the effectiveness of the response.
   - Document lessons learned and update the incident response plan accordingly.
